# Backend Implementation Guide for Authentication System

## Key Authentication Features to Implement

### 1. User Authentication Endpoints

#### Login System
The login form expects an API endpoint at `/api/auth/login` that:
- Validates the email and password
- Handles rate limiting for failed attempts
- Returns appropriate JWT tokens upon successful authentication
- Provides clear error messages without exposing sensitive information

#### Registration System
The signup form posts to `/api/auth/register` and expects:
- Email uniqueness validation
- Password hashing with a strong algorithm
- CAPTCHA verification with Google's API
- Account creation with proper validation
- Optional email verification system

### 2. Security Measures

Here are some security features I've considered in the frontend that need backend support:

- **Rate Limiting**: The login form handles temporary blocks client-side, but we need server-side rate limiting
- **CAPTCHA Validation**: The signup form collects CAPTCHA tokens, but they need server verification
- **Password Storage**: Passwords should be properly hashed (bcrypt with appropriate rounds)
- **JWT Implementation**: Consider token expiration, refresh mechanisms, and secure storage

## Freedom for Additional Features

Feel free to expand on this foundation with features like:

- **Multi-factor Authentication**: Add SMS or email verification codes
- **Session Management**: Track active sessions and allow users to view/terminate them
- **Account Recovery**: Implement a secure password reset flow
- **User Profiles**: Add endpoints for profile management
- **Role-Based Access**: Implement different permission levels
- **Audit Logging**: Track login attempts and security events
- **IP-Based Security**: Add location-based alerts for suspicious logins

## Technology Recommendations

You have complete freedom to choose your tech stack, but here are some suggestions:

- **Node.js with Express**: Fast to set up and matches our JavaScript frontend
- **MongoDB/PostgreSQL**: Both work well for user data
- **Redis**: Great for rate limiting and temporary blocks
- **JWT Libraries**: jsonwebtoken for Node.js works well
- **bcrypt**: Industry standard for password hashing
